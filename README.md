    When trying to answer a specific question I have, or find out more about a
particular subject, I like to use internet forums and their capability to
search posts within specific subforums to get an overview of my subject. I
find this user-submitted information to be an easily-digestible, relatable
way to learn, and by internally indentifying common themes in posts, I can
determine which pieces of information are most likely reliable or
significant.

    That's probably more words than necessary to describe what humans have been
doing for 6 million years. Teaching each other about the world through
communication. The problem is sifting through and reading hundreds of posts
is a time-consuming process.

    Reddit contains an enormous amount of searchable user-submitted information
on a multitude of subjects, and this program is an attempt to automate my
own "forum-assisted" learning process, with the goal of identifying common
themes after performing a Reddit search query.
